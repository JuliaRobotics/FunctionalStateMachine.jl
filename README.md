Build a state machine in Julia based on functions along with stepping and visualization tools  

# Installation
## [OPTIONAL] System Dependencies
Visualization tools require a system install of `graphviz`.  Do Ubuntu/Debian Linux equivalent of:
```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

## Install Julia Package
Julia â‰¥ 0.7 add package
```julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add FunctionalStateMachine
```

# Example

## Basic
```julia
using FunctionalStateMachine

## User state functions
function bar!(usrdata)
  println("do bar!")
  return FunctionalStateMachine.exitStateMachine
end

function foo!(usrdata)
  println("do foo!")
  return bar!
end

# no user data struct defined, so just pass Nothing
statemachine = StateMachine{Nothing}(next=foo!)
while statemachine(nothing, verbose=true); end

# or maybe limit number of steps
statemachine = StateMachine{Nothing}(next=foo!)
while statemachine(nothing, iterlimit=1); end
```

## With User Data and History

```julia
## Passing a data structure
mutable struct ExampleUserData
  x::Vector{Float64}
end

# or maybe record the state machine history
statemachine = StateMachine{ExampleUserData}(next=foo!)
eud = ExampleUserData(randn(10))
while statemachine(eud, recordhistory=true); end

# recover recorded state transition history, `::Vector{Tuple{DateTime,Int,Function,T}}`
hist = statemachine.history

# or maybe rerun a step on the data as it was at that time -- does not overwrite previous memory
new_eud_at_1 = sandboxStateMachineStep(hist, 1)
```

## Draw State Pictures with Graphviz

```julia
# ]add Graphs # in case the dependency is not installed yet

using Graphs

# run the state machine
statemachine = StateMachine{ExampleUserData}(next=foo!)
eud = ExampleUserData(randn(10))
while statemachine(eud, recordhistory=true); end

# draw the state machine
hist = statemachine.history
drawStateMachineHistory(hist, show=true)
```

## Animate Asyncronous State Machine Transitions

The following example function shows several state machines that were run asyncronously can be synchronously animated:
```julia
using Dates, DocStringExtensions

"""
    $SIGNATURES

Draw many images in '/tmp/?/csm_%d.png' representing time synchronized state machine
events.

Notes
- State history must have previously been recorded.
"""
function animateStateMachines(histories::Vector{<:Tuple}; frames::Int=100)

  startT = Dates.now()
  stopT = Dates.now()

  # get start and stop times across all cliques
  first = true
  # hist = somestatemachine.history
  for hist in histories
    if hist[1][1] < startT
      startT = hist[1][1]
    end
    if first
      stopT = hist[end][1]
    end
    if stopT < hist[end][1]
      stopT= hist[end][1]
    end
  end

  # export all figures
  folders = String[]
  count = 0
  for hist in histories
    count += 1
    retval = animateStateMachineHistoryByTime(hist, frames=frames, folder="sm$count", title="SM-$count", startT=startT, stopT=stopT)
    push!(folders, "sm$count")
  end

  return folders
end

# animate the time via many png images in `/tmp`
animateCliqStateMachines([hist1; hist2], frames=100)
```

This example will result in 100 images for both `hist1, hist` state machine history. Note the timestamps are used to synchronize animations images on concurrent state traversals, and can easily be made into a video with OpenShot or ffmpeg style tools.
